# NoteGrid

A simple productivity app to organize your tasks and bookmarks.

## What is NoteGrid?

NoteGrid helps you manage tasks using two proven methods:

- **Eisenhower Matrix** - Sort tasks by urgency and importance into 4 quadrants: Do, Schedule, Delegate, Eliminate
- **Kanban Board** - Track task progress through stages: Backlog → To Do → In Progress → Done

Plus a **Bookmarks** manager to save links you want to keep.

## Available On

- **Web** - [notegrid.app](https://notegrid.app)
- **iOS & Android** - Flutter app
- **Chrome Extension** - Save bookmarks with one click

All your data syncs automatically across devices.

## No Account Required

NoteGrid uses a unique code instead of username/password. When you first open the app, you'll get a code like this:

```
a1b2c3d4-e5f6-7890-abcd-ef1234567890
```

**Save this code somewhere safe** - it's the only way to access your data. Enter the same code on any device to sync your tasks.

## Features

- Drag and drop tasks between quadrants and columns
- Color-code your tasks
- Add notes and tags to tasks
- Dark mode
- Export your data as JSON
- Works offline (syncs when back online)

## Privacy

Your data is stored securely and tied only to your unique code. No email, no tracking, no ads.
