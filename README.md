## What is NoteGrid?

NoteGrid is a cross-platform app that helps you manage your todos and links:

- **Eisenhower Matrix** - Sort tasks by urgency and importance into 4 quadrants: Do, Schedule, Delegate, Eliminate
- **Kanban Board** - Track task progress through stages: Backlog, To Do, In Progress, Done
- **Bookmarks manager** - Save links for later reference.

All your data syncs automatically across devices.

## No Account Required

NoteGrid uses a unique UUID generated on registering instead of username/password. Store it somewhere safe as it is the only way to access your data:
